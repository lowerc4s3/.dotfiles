# Deprecated configs

This directory is a trash bin of my old unused Neovim configs which include:
- Unmaintained plugins
- Outdated plugin configurations
- Straight up complete mess

These configs stay in the repo only to save settings which I might use when migrating
to new plugins. I'll probably remove them some day.
